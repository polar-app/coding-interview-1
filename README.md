We're going to build a language classifier.

Implement it in the following order: 

- NGramParser.ts
- NGramProfiles.ts
- NGramProfilesDistance.ts
- LangClassifier.ts

You can get stated by running


```bash
npm install
npm run compile
npm run test
```


At this point ALL the tests will fail. It's your job to implement the code and fix them.
